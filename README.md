BARCH stands for Bayesian Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, and it is a statistical model used to estimate the volatility of financial returns over time, which can be used to assess risk and inform investment decisions, although you shouldn't blindly trust mine (or mine only)

GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, computational tool that is used to estimate the volatility of financial time series data. It is based on the GARCH model, which is a mathematical framework that allows for the modeling of time-varying volatility in financial data.

RSI is a Relative Strength Index, which are used to show strength of a (mostly US) traded equity, ETF, or future relative to past performance. 
"The relative strength index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in stock trading analysis to measure the strength of a stock's price action by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of an asset.
The RSI is calculated using a formula that takes into account the average gain and average loss over a specified time period. The resulting value ranges from 0 to 100, with a value of 70 or above indicating an overbought condition and a value of 30 or below indicating an oversold condition."
